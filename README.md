# What can it  do?
  - Convert part of .amc script with only mouse movement and delays to lua code
  - convert lua code from one sensitivity to another

# What I learnt?
  - Cheating in games is not good
  
# How to use?
  - In file amctologi.py change variable amccode to part of amc script. Run the script, then you can find new lua in the same folder with script named output_changesensitivity.lua
  - In file changesensitivity.py change old to old sensitivity and new to sensitivity that you want, paste old lua to variable old_lua. Run the script, then you can find new lua in the same folder with script named output_changesensitivity.lua
